        <h1>Education</h1>
        <p>I am apart of Pembina Trails Early College (PTEC). In grade 9 and 10 half of the day is spent at our host schools and the 
        other half is spent at Smart Park. When we are at our hosts school that is when we do our mandatory courses. When we are at
        Smart Park we learn out technology based courses, which are Software Development and Networking/Cyber Security. In grade 11
        and 12 half the day is at our host schools and the other half is at MITT. At MITT we will choose which stream we want to go 
        into, Software Development or Networking and Cyber Security. By the end of grade 12 we will have a highschool diploma and 
        a college diploma. A link to the PTEC website can be found <a href="https://www.pembinatrails.ca/schools/earlycollege/Pages/default.aspx">here</a>.</p>
